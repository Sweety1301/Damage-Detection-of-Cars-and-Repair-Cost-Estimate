# Damage-Detection-of-Cars-and-Repair-Cost-Estimate
The increased vehicle presence on roads has produced both more accidents involving 
expanded compensation costs. Most current damage assessment relies on human inspectors 
who conduct manual vehicle assessments but the methods face two primary shortcomings 
from subjective human appraisals and slow manual processes. The use of inadequate 
assessment techniques leads to delayed processes that bring about unhappy customers. 

Insurance organizations must tackle two essential requirements including precise damage 
verification and immediate cost assessment for repair expenses. Humans conduct manual 
vehicle inspection through human adjusters for damage assessment though this practice takes 
long times and shows inconsistent results in addition to human assessment errors. The 
productivity issues generate operational delays which both increase expense costs and 
decrease customer satisfaction.
